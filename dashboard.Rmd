### Overview 

**COVID-19** is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic has received much attention in the scientific world, prompting researchers to actively explore the potential socioeconomic factors affecting the spread of COVID-19 and and mortality rates. 

This dashboard is intended to provide a visual representation of selected socioeconomic 
factors that may impact the spread of the disease as well as mortality rates across countries. 

**How to Use:** The interactive map on the right provides country-specific status relating to COVID-19. You may click to drag the map around, or click the '+' and '-' buttons to zoom in and out. You may click a marker to reveal a popup with information about the specific country.
